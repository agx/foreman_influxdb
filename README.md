# ForemanInfluxdb

Adds influxdb support for [Foreman](http://theforeman.org).

This Foreman plugin allows to use influxdb to track performance
metrics of your foreman instances.

You will need to install a influxdb instance to use this plugin.

## Configuration

The influxdb host(s) and options can be changed by adding settings to
`/usr/share/foreman/config/settings.plugins.d/foreman-influxdb.yaml`,
or Foreman's own `settings.yaml`.

Example config file:

```yaml
:influxdb:
  :hosts:
    - localhost
  :port: 8086
```

The InfluxDB server needs to have a database named *theforeman*
already. It can be created via

    influx -execute "CREATE DATABASE theforeman"
